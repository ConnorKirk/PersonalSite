<p>I came across two great new words today (in the Economist - Thanks Emily). I’m not sure I’ll get the chance to use them in conversation any time soon..</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sophistry</strong> Complex arguments to support a point that are purposely misleading</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sinecure</strong> A position or status that offers finacial or other benefits for little or no work</p></li>
</ul>
