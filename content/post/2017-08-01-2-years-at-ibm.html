<h1>Two Years at IBM</h1>
<p>On July 27th 2017 I reached my two year anniversairy at IBM. Coincidentally, I had an internal interview the day previous. In it, I was asked “If you could go back to the beginning, what would you tell yourself?”. I thought it was an interesting question (must be why it’s now a cliche).</p>
<p>My two years at IBM have had highs and lows. I don’t think I could have avoided all of the lows, but I think with the right advice, I could have maybe shortened them. At the same time, there have been some lessons that I’ve heard before, but I haven’t learnt until I’ve had the weight of my own experience to drive them home. I suppose that’s the cruel part of learning from other people. You can listen, but you won’t understand always.</p>
<p>I suppose my IBM career can be simplified into a few broad strokes</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Burning out on my first project</li>
<li>Moving to become more technical</li>
<li>Getting involved with the <strong>extracurricular activities</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Burning Out</h2>
<p>I was on my first project for nearly a year. It’s only a year later that I can appreciate all that I learnt whilst on it. I took a lot of experience for granted at the time. TO try and avoid the experiences that taught me all of that would be silly, it’s who I am now. But if I could message myself, I would advise the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get help. Don’t suffer in silence. If something isn’t clear, ask. If they can’t help, ask someone else. Keep asking.</li>
<li>Stand up for yourself. Everyone has an agenda (not in a machivellian aspect), everyone has their own problems, both in work and outside. People are great, but you shouldn’t rely on them to solve your problems, or look out for yourself. I was in my first project for far longer than beneficial because I went with the flow to support other people, rather than insisting to move on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Becoming more technical</h2>
<p>Soon after joining IBM, I decided I wanted to become <em>technical</em>. I’d looked on longingly at those with the ability to code, but I never believed I could do it. Since then, I’ve started following my interests. It’s been stop-start, bumpy, disheartening, but slowly successful. I feel a bit like climbing to the top of the mountain, only to realise there’s another peak behind, that’s even further away. The more I learn, the more I discover I don’t know. Finding the time to learn more is difficult, but it’s taught me to start reflecting the quality and quantity of what I do. “Is this taking me towards my goals?”.</p>
<p>I’d tell myself</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes you can do it! I wish I’d started earlier</li>
<li>It’s okay to get distracted, feel overwhelmed. It takes time, practice and a bit of luck.</li>
</ul>

<div id="getting-involved" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use giveback to my advantage.</li>
<li>Find opportunities that interest me</li>
<li>Mentoring</li>
<li>Data Analysis</li>
</ul>
