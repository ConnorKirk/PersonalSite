<p>Recently, I was asked “How should we measure productivity” within the context of a customer services team. Here are the thoughts I put together.</p>
<div id="how-do-we-define-productivity" class="section level1">
<h1>How do we define productivity?</h1>
<p>Productivity is defined as the rate of input to desired output.</p>
<p>This definition is rather abstract though. Context is everything. So how should we measure productivity in a customer operations team?</p>
<p>The core function of the customer operations team is to respond to inbound customer requests. Successful customer service would involve: * Respond to majority of inbound engagements from customers * Solving the query in a high quality resolution (not all answers are equal). * Time to solve a query? * Time to respond to a query - Could this be part of the above?</p>
<p>These would all need to be considered in a measure of productivity.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple measure. We could measure productivity as the number of customer operations team required to respond to these engagements. ie</p>
<p><code>Productivity = Number of Customer Engagements / Number of Customer Operations Team Members</code></p>
<p>But this ignores some other factors. If we put weight with purely the number of engagements served by a team, we ignore a big factor - Quality. This is harder to quantify (which explains the number of overseas call centres). Not all customer services are equal.</p>
<p>Our current definition is naive. In fact, optimising for it could damage, not improve our goal, as we would modify behaviour and processes to improve throughput but not accounting for quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-factors-to-consider" class="section level1">
<h1>Other Factors to consider</h1>
<p>As we’ve discussed above, we can’t just judge productivity on the number of engagements per team members. So what else do we need to consider?</p>
<div id="quality" class="section level2">
<h2>Quality</h2>
</div>
<div id="number-of-inbound-engagements" class="section level2">
<h2>Number of Inbound Engagements</h2>
</div>
<div id="time-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Time period</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div id="is-maximum-productivity-producitive" class="section level1">
<h1>Is maximum productivity producitive?</h1>
<p>To finish this discussion, I wanted to discuss the unquantifiable part of customer service. The human interaction, the feeling you have after a great conversation. Whilst this is difficult to measure, it shouldn’t be ignored. If you’re customer service team can handle 1,000 customer service engagements a day, would you want it to be at capacity all the time?</p>
<p>A lower utilisation would allow the customer services team to shine.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-final-thought" class="section level1">
<h1>A final thought</h1>
<p>As with everything, these measurements don’t exist in an abstract space. Speaking to the Customer Operations team would be a wise step before I prescribed a good measure for productivity. We should test our measure to see if it is meaningful.</p>
