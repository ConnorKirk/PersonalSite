# Ideas to change Ball Choice culture

## Nudge theory

defaults

- option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option

social proof heuristics

- Tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior.

increasing the salience of the desired option.
When an individualâ€™s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option

## Default

Provide single yellow balls as spares, not double
Sell single yellow balls at the shop
Use single yellow balls in training.

## Social Proof

- Find single yellow advocates at a good club level. Aim to spread this down. Convince one person, then spread it.
- Sheet - WHat ball did you use. How was it!? Temperature?

- Poster about professionals using single dot in cold weather or solo training

## Salience

- Posters informing about
  - Court temp
  - Ball selection at different temps

Hi Nick,

My name is Connor. We met briefly on your UK tour at Beaconsfield Squash Club late last year where you ran the adult training session.
I'm writing because you've been such an advocate for the sport in the UK. I appreciate you're busy, so I've kept this brief.

I believe most club players using a double yellow ball would benefit from using the single dot ball instead (especially at the moment!). I'd like to know do you ever use faster balls, either playing matches, training or in the cold weather?
