I came across two great new words today (in the Economist - Thanks Emily).
I'm not sure I'll get the chance to use them in conversation any time soon..

## Sophistry 
Complex arguments to support a point that are purposely misleading

## Sinecure
A position or status that offers finacial or other benefits for little or no work
