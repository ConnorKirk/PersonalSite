I came across two great new words today (in the Economist - Thanks Emily).
I'm not sure I'll get the chance to use them in conversation any time soon..

- __Sophistry__ 
Complex arguments to support a point that are purposely misleading

- __Sinecure__
A position or status that offers finacial or other benefits for little or no work
