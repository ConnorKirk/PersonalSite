<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>What am I discussing</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently there is an ongoing debate in the professional squash community. At the world championships in Dubai, the format of the matches was changed, from Best of 5 games to just Best of 3. The response to this has been fascinating, with well thought out arguments from a number of professional players and coaches.</p>
<p>Following the tournement, Malcom Willstrop, coach and father to James Willstrop wrote an article suggesting it was time to move to best of 3 in professional tournments (the lifeblood of the professional squash). Many players quickly declared for a particular camp, with many writing arguments to support their case.</p>

<h1>What do the professional’s say?</h1>
<p>Nick Matthew has written a very good argument based on this. He argues that Best of 3 style tournements could be mixed in with Best of 5, similar to cricket with it’s 20/20 and 5 day internationals.</p>
<p>Others have outright declared Best of 3 the future of squash, adding that it’s evolve or die. This is contested by others who argue that a move to best of 3 would reduce the value of endurance and fitness of a sport famed for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-difference" class="section level1">
<h1>What is the difference?</h1>
<p>At it’s core, the best of 3 format is not just a truncated best of 5. A player would likely be stronger at one format than the other, depending on their play style. Perhaps this has coloured player’s opinion on the proposed change?</p>
<p>Best of 3 increases the importance of every point. There’s far less room to wriggle. * Urgency * Less leeway * Matches will be a maximum of 3 games, rather than a minimum of 3. Knowing this, the game shifts from valuing the fitness/endurance. Knowing you have only 1 spare game (11 points), you don’t have much leeway. It’s argued that this raises the intensity, aggression and excitement of the match.</p>
<p>I think that the best of three format has a very different profile (flavour?) to best of 5, akin to the change from English to American style scoring, (and to a lesser extent the move from 15 point games to 11).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Less intense tournement paths. Squash tournements are quite condensed affairs. A 5 game match early in a tournement will probably still be hurting by the time you next play. Reducing the games to 3 will allow players to be in a better state for the finals. It may reduce their risk of injury?</p></li>
<li><p>Would match length be affected?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To win a best of 5 game, you need to win 3 matches. In each match, you need to be the first to 11 points (excluding 2-clear at 10-10). In best of three, this reduces to just 2 games, and 22 points. At first glance it seems obvious that matches will be shorter. Is this a desired consequence?</p>
