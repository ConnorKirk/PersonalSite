<p>The majority of the food I eat (and enjoy), I wouldn’t have considered 5 years ago. In that time, my diet has changed significantly. I attribute the majority of this change to living with my girlfriend, who expanded my horizons.</p>
<p>Without her, I never would have discovered the wonder of Aubergine. (Or maybe I would have, but we will never know).</p>
<p>My attitude to food in that time has changed significantly as well. This post is an attempt to clarify the thoughts that have been developing recently.</p>
<p>At university 7 years ago, my staple foods were Chicken Curry, Sausage Pasta, Chicken Fajitas and Peanut Butter. These were coincidentally the foods I knew how to cook. You could template every meal as either rice/pasta with sauce or potato based, meat and a vegetable.</p>
<p>The change between myself now and then has been the changing of this template. Now, a standard meal for me would be</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Vegeatable (Cavalo Nero, Brocolli, Spinach, Salad)</li>
<li>Meat (Chicken, Sausage).</li>
</ul>
<p>The potato staple of my diet has been replaced with green veg.</p>
<p>As well as the template of my diet, my attitude with food has also changed. Food has almost become two seperate ideas for me, which I try to compromise between.</p>
<div id="food" class="section level3">
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>“The key ingredients of cooking. Building blocks of delicious meals. Something that can bring joy”</p>
</div>
<div id="food-1" class="section level3">
<h3>“Food”</h3>
<p>“The nutrition needed to fuel the body. The ingredients in will directly affect performance, visuals and feel of my body”.&quot;</p>
<p>Every meal now can sometimes feel like a choice between the two types of food. “Food” for performance is growing in importance for me as I improve at Squash and Running. Having done a month of vegetarianism, and a month of Low Carb - High Fat, I’ve been to notice the real impact that food has on my mood and energy.</p>
<p>It seems that food can give me both short and long term happiness, but the foods types that give each don’t neccessarily intersect.</p>
<p>THis seems quite negative, but actually I have begun to enjoy what I consider “performance food” and at the same time have completely lost interest in other food. Icecream, Crisps, Sugary drinks all now are too sweet to enjoy. I think this was an unintentional benefit of my low-carb month. After avoiding sugary items for so long, my perception of sweetness seems to have increased.</p>
<p>My thoughts at the moment are how can I balance between the two? I love food, I love cooking. TO exclude whole classes of items from my diet and cooking repetoire seems excessive.</p>
<p>I like to think there is a compromise. Currently, I try to eat “clean” whilst away Monday - Wednesday nights. Now that I’ve established a pattern, this is simple to follow. Salad + Precooked Meat/Fish, then Greek Yoghurt/Cream + Fruit. I’m sure it can be optimised, but at the moment I think it works.</p>
<p>However, it’s a entirely different ball game Thursday - Sunday. My weakness is peanut butter, I love it. I’ll eat it by the spoonful. Whilst not unhealthy, eating multiple spoonfuls a day in addition to set meals seems to be excessive. It’s also hampering my weight loss goals. A strict resolution would be to stop buying it!</p>
<p>This has become far more than I was expecting to write. It’s suffered “scope creep” as well. But having wrote all of this, I’ve realised that the food I enjoy is shifting to become the food that’s also good for me. Regular exposure to it (and avoiding the bad stuff) seems to be shifting my taste. Maybe one day I will no longer enjoy a gooey brownie with lashings of cream and a side of peanut butter. Or maybe I’ll just have to save it for when I’m bulking.</p>
