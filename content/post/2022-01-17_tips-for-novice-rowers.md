## General

* Have a small waterproof bag
  * Rigger jigger - sometimes useful mid outing, tape, lights
  * Maybe some food/fuel for long outings
* Kit bag
  * Decent size hold all for when you have training camps or a day racing.
  Paracetamol & antihistamine
  Plasters
  Electrical tape or similar


* Also bring a towel and dry change of clothes - Often get splashed. Sometimes can capsize
  * You should treat yourself and include dry underwear and socks.
* Decent hand cream for your poor hands (O'Keefe's working hands)


* Lights
  * Bike lights are better value than "rowing" lights. 
  * Get ones that are "see-me" rather than lighting up infront of you. Otherwise you risk blinding other users of the river

## Winter
* If you can, bring a dry set of kit per outing
* Pogis are invaluable if your hands get cold
* Hat is small and regulate temp
