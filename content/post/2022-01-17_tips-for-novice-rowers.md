Here's a list of useful kit I've collected since I've started rowing. 
## General

* Have a small waterproof bag. Ideally you can fasten it to the footplate
  * Rigger jigger - sometimes useful mid outing,
   * tape
  * Maybe some food/fuel for long outings
  * A little snack
  * Keep your lights in there
  * Any dry clothes for the outing
* Kit bag
  * Decent size hold all for when you have training camps or a day racing.
  * Paracetamol & antihistamine
  * Plasters
  * Electrical tape or similar
  * Boat lights - Don't get caught out
* Lights
  * If you're going out at night, fog or early morning, good lights are essential. 
  * Lights can be too bright. Your lights are for others to see you. If they're blinding others, then you're dangerous.
  * Aim for atleast 100 lumens (or whatever your club recommends)
  * Use electrical tape to fix on. Consider a boat mount like [this one](https://theflyingboatman.co.uk/product/stern-light-mount/) designed for bike lights. 
  * Bike lights are generally better value and designed for similar conditions. They can get knocked, so use tape to secure it if you can't wrap on the strap
  * Dim lights are dangerous. 
  * Get ones that are "see-me" rather than lighting up infront of you. Otherwise you risk blinding other users of the river
  * Lights with a narrow field of view can make you invisible when turning. Try to buy lights with a wide field of view.


* Bring a towel and dry change of clothes - Often get splashed. Sometimes can capsize
  * You should treat yourself and include dry underwear and socks. Feels amazing
  * If you often get wet socks with wellies, consider waterproof socks. Recommended by my cox
* Decent hand cream for dry hands (O'Keefe's working hands is good)




## Winter

* If you can, bring a dry set of kit per outing
* Pogies are invaluable if your hands get cold. Don't worry about looking uncool. Just row faster than them
* A hat is small and a nice way regulate your temperature
