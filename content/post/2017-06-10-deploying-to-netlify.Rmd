After creating the skeleton of the site using `blogdown`, my first goal is to get it up and running on netlify, using a free domain name. After I've achieved that, I'll consider a custom domain name (that will be another post..)


The [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) contains the basics to get started, but I seem to have hit an error when netlify tries to build the site. Maybe creating a basic walkthrough tutorial from R project to netlify site would be a useful contribution (once I've fixed the problem)
