<h1>Burgers</h1>
<p>For the past few months I’ve been slacking. Burger nights have become a common weekend dinner. Peanut butter, fried onions, mayoniaise, sweet chilli sauce are all regularly featured.</p>
<p>Every time though, I’ve taken the path of least resistance and bought pre-made burgers. Despite my best efforts, they’ve always tasted better than my own attempts. Better texture, better flavour (and also easier).</p>
<p>Recently though, I came across the burger section “The Food Lab” by J. Kenji Lopez. It’s inspired me to try again at burger mastery. I’m pleased to say this weekend I came a step closer.</p>
<div id="what-worked" class="section level2">
<h2>What worked?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Freshly ground meat from the Farmers Market. This was an instant winner, with a much better texture and taste than store bought.</p></li>
<li><p>Freshly made sourdough bun from the Farmers Market. This managed to hold it’s integrity despite the juices.</p></li>
<li><p>Toasting the buns with butter in a pan. This created a lovely crisp texture and golden colour.</p></li>
<li><p>Resting the burgers after cooking</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="what-could-be-better" class="section level2">
<h2>What could be better?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I still managed to overcook the burger! Next time I need to be more strict with measuring the internal temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>At 200g, the burgers were a quite large for my preference. Next time I will try smaller ~120g patties.</p></li>
<li><p>Toppings. Maybe I just missed peanut butter (thanks diet), but it seemed a little bland. Next time I’d like to plan a more cohesive topping selection ahead of time, rather than making it up on the spot.</p></li>
<li><p>Photo’s! I should take some photos of the steps and results.</p></li>
</ul>
