# Squash has a problem

There's not huge amounts of data available for squash membership, but read the (squash) news and you can see that the game is facing challenges. Members clubs are closing, leisure centre courts are being converted, and the average age of members is going increasing.
The game itself hasn't worsened in this time, if anything it has improved. Squash TV produces exceptionally high quality coverage of tournements. Squash Skills provides world class coaching online for a low fee. Squash Levels produces fascinating ratings of players according to their match results. So what's happened?

* Declining memberships
* Increasing average age
* Dearth of new members
* Less clubs


* Get some data?  
> [Sport England statistics show that 500,000 people regularly play squash in England and that there are 900 affiliated clubs and 4,500 squash courts across the country.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/squash/8701685.stm)
* [Squash declining membership](https://www.statista.com/statistics/490339/squash-racketball-participation-uk/)

The squash player "funnel"/conversion
* Interested (Friend/referall?)
* Sign up
* ????
* Engaged member (Playing leagues, training, attracting new members)

* Great sport
    * Health benefits
    * Flexible
    * Easy to pratice & Improve
* Starting squash is hard
    * Lots to learn
    * Cold ball problem
    * Too much freedom/flexibility
    * Leagues are intimidating



Before I played squash, I worked at a squash club. Attracting new members was hard. Keeping them and developing them was very rare. "Needs data" -> Most advanced squash players start at a young age. There isn't a pipeline to develop adult beginners to a good club level. I think this is a gap most clubs don't address. Here I propose how it could be addressed, why it might help, and how to measure it.

## The Problem

Whilst most clubs have a junior program (to varying success), there is little support for adult members joining the club. These adults members often join but struggle to engage with the club through a variety of measures (entrance into leagues, skill, frequency at club, skill/development). The onus is left to the new joiner or their referer to teach them the basics, introduce them to other similar members, get them into the leagues etc. This is a common problem for all new joiners, and the solution could be centralised scheme provided by the club. The club is better placed to provide this, getting efficiency (teaching 5 new members only a little more than teaching 1), and aligning incentives (the club wants more, better members)

## The Solution

Provide a template scheme for Clubs, similar to [Squash Girls Can](https://www.englandsquash.com/get-involved/play/ways-to-play/squash-girls-can), to make it easy to implement a new joiners session. It should be easy for one (or a small group) of club players to run this scheme regularly in the year, requiring only::
* time investment,
* backing of the club 
* enthusiasm to grow the game

This framework would contain:
* Lesson plan (Concepts to teach, suggested routines)
* Advertising
* Scheme structure
* Ways to measure success:
    * # of Starters
    * # Completing
    * # Playing one year later

An important part of this is to keep records of success to understand what is working. There are many possible variances to this. Determining the most successful requires measurement
* Regular session year round, or batch a group of session together once a year?
* Size of the session (Is it linked to # of available courts?)
* TO charge? (Increases buyin/motivation)


## Getting new Members & Keeping them
* How can we improve the new player experience
    * Better skill standard
    * Skills/habits to keep playing/improving
    * First cohort of players to play with

* Take inspiration from other sports
    * Rowing
        * 8 week learn to row
        * Cohort of new joiners, all in similar boat
        * Coaching, introduction to the norms, teach basic skills
        * Provide pathway to continue at the club, not just left to their own devices or relying on friends etc

* Learn to Squash program
    * Formalise how people start the game
    * Open the "junior experience" to all players
    * Mixture of training, match play, socialising
    * Create a cohort
    * Teach the basic skills/knowledge of the game
    * Introduce team training, solo practice and friendly matches
