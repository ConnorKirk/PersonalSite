<h1>Mindful Eating</h1>
<p>After a few years of eating wit my girlfriend, my basic diet is quite good. I enjoy salads, a wide variety of fish and vegetables and the rest. I even now finding myself uninterested in food when I’m full, and choosing “healthier” options because I think they taste better. I’m really pleased with this. It’s a large change from when I was younger!</p>
<p>But in my long walk towards for self-improvement, I’ve noticed that I still have one unhealthy tendancy. I often binge eat, especially sweet foods like biscuits, cookies and other baked goods. It’s become very binary, in that I can either eat none, and I will be fine. But if I have one, I’ll have two. Then a third. Suddenly the entire packet is empty. This isn’t ideal. It’s definitely worse than eating an entire bag of carrots!</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>
<p>There’s a few things at play</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to stop after “just one”. Should I try to build a pattern of eating just one?</li>
<li>Being mindful when I’m eating. It’s often convenience foods, that I can eat whilst doing something else. If I were to only eat these foods when doing nothing else, perhaps I would be less likely to eat it all!</li>
<li>Avoid purchasing food that I will likely binge eat</li>
<li>Peanut butter</li>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Brownies</li>
<li>Biscuits</li>
<li>Chocolate</li>
</ul>
