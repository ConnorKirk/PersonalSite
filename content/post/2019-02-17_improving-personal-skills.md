## Things that I found useful

When I was younger, I was very socially awkward. I didn't know how to be around other people. This continued for a lot of my childhood, culminating when I was about 15. I realised on my current track I was going to have all sorts of awkwardness ahead of me.
I didn't know how, but the thought of awkward encounters for the rest of my life drove me to try and fix it. I read a lot to try and learn what seemed obvious to everyone else.
Since then, I'm slightly more comfortable in social settings. I'm glad I've made the effort, but I think there's a lot further to go.

* What is this?



## Things that I found useful 
###  How to win friends and influence people
Despite it's slightly nefarious sounding name, this gave me great structure on how to interact with people. In hindsight it's all obvious, but this book gives a good direction of how to be around other people. I found it well written. The stories provide relatable examples, yet stand on their own merit as interesting.  

I'll always remember reading a review befor epurchasing this book. It warned potential readers that this book will turn you into a sociopath. You'll learn the levers to move people top your bidding. I don't fully disagree (but I'm not a social mastermind by any stretch). Instead, I see the principles as ways to inspire and dictate the interactions you wanted to have with others.  

### Soft Skills Engineering

This is a fun podcast that talks about the non-technical side of technical work. I often find it hard to differentiate between reasonable and unreasonable. Should I say something, or is this just part of life. This podcast gives me more evidence when I make my thoughts. Also very funny.

### Never Eat Alone

I think I came across this recommendation on Hacker News. It's a book encouraging you to build your network. Again, it's a mix of advice and example tales.

### Improv by Keith Johnston

Before I make this recomendation, I need to caveat that I enjoyed this book until the last chapter on "Masks". Perhaps I just need to try it..?
This is an excellent book for giving a mental model of social status and interactions between people. Whilst aimed at improv comedy, the observations are valid for everyday life.
It includes a many exercises that I think would be fun for a budding group of people working to improve their social skills.
## What else looks useful

### Presentation skills

* Presenting is a super power
	* Get you known to many others
	* Associate yourself with a topic
	* Create once, then use many time (iterate and improve)
	* Learn what you're talking about
* How to improve presentations
	* Talk like TED
		* Great book. Frame each presentation as a story.
	* Toast Masters
		* Get lots of practice. Get feedback.
	* Stand up comedy/improv?
		* I've yet to prove it to myself, but I get the impression improv  comedy makes you a better speaker.  You learn to go with the flow, don't get shaken. This helps make your presentations much smoother. You may even get a few laughs.
