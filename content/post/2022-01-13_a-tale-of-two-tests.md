How quickly can you row 2000 meters? 

The 2k test is a classic method for comparing the fitness of rowers, either in a boat or on an erg machine.


I was _fortunate_ to do two tests in two months. I achieved similar scores in both, yet the ~7 minutes felt very different. The first felt good. I finished feeling like I had more to give. It was fun!

The second was the polar opposite. It hurt. I don't think I could have done much more. The large contrast fascinates me as I can't explain it. 

The first test had all the hall marks of going poorly:

* No real warmup (I was late)
* I had my booster jab earlier that day
* I had done little 2k prep, and had no goal time/split
* I hadn't set up my HR monitor or motivational messages
* I had low expectations for myself!

Yet despite that, it went surprisingly well.

The second test was the opposite in most aspects:

* Plenty of warmup
* No fatigue (apart from a weights session the prior day)
* HR Monitor and motivational messages prepared
* Clear plan
* Expectations to meet.


Clearly, I'd prefer future tests to feel like the first. The most obvious way is to get fitter. 
It doesn't explain the difference between the two. I considered if my fitness had deteriorated over the month, but I don't think that's the case. 
If anything, I did more training, as I had free time over the holidays.
So if it's not a question of physical fitness, could it be something else? 
Perhaps elements I can control? 
I'm interested in the psychological component of endurance sports, as it has been shown to have a large impact on performance.

Factors I'd like to explore

* Expectations and the feeling of pressure on performance
* Race plan (steady pacing vs u-shaped performance)
* Does technology like HR monitor or motivational messages help?
* Audience and encouragement?
