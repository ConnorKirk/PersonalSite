Hi there!

My name is Connor Kirkpatrick.

This blog is my space for whatever crosses my mind or catches my interest. It's a place for me to practice my writing,
process my thoughts and record what I learn.

I started this site whilst trying to get my first technical job. With a bit of luck, and a lot of good colleagues, I have been fortunate to get experience with a wide range of technologies, such as:

- Migrating a database, changing the schema along the way
- Building websites in React
- Creating a workshop for CloudFormation
- Building APIs

I enjoy public speaking (but still get nervous). I'm not sure that will ever go away.

All views are my own, please don't take them too seriously.
