Hi there!

My name is Connor Kirkpatrick.

You can contact me via website (at) ckp (dot) fyi, or find me on twitter/github etc

This blog is my space for whatever crosses my mind or catches my interest. It's a place for me to practice my writing,
process my thoughts and record what I learn.

At the moment I am a developer. I'm captain of my local rowing club in my spare time.

I started this site whilst trying to get my first technical job. With a bit of luck, and a lot of good colleagues, I have been fortunate to get experience with a wide range of technologies, such as:

- Migrating a database, changing the schema along the way
- Building websites in React
- Creating a workshop for CloudFormation
- Building APIs


All views are my own, please don't take them too seriously.

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
