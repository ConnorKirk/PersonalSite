Hello World.

My name is Connor Kirkpatrick. 
This blog is my space for whatever crosses my mind or catches my interest. It's a place for me to practice my writing, process my thoughts and record what I learn.

All views are my own, please don't take them too seriously. 


This site was created using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package by Yihui Xie. It uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
