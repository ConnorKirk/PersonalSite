Hello World.

My name is Connor Kirkpatrick. I'm a consultant at IBM, where I help companies with their data and databases.
This blog is my space for whatever crosses my mind or catches my interest. It's a place for me to practice my writing, process my thoughts and record what I learn.

All views are my own, please don't take them too seriously. 

**Don't believe everything you read on the internet.**

This site was created using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package by Yihui Xie.
