# To Do

* Write up post on going from creating a project to deploying on netlify
* ~~Update about me section. See Yihui's own for a good example.~~
* ~~Update config settings. Currently using defaults~~
* Investigate swapping to Cocoa or Goa Hugo Theme?
* Study Hugo further


# Post Ideas

* Squash
* Student Tuition Fee's
* Cooking
* Making time for goals
* Finding a hobby.
* Two years at IBM
* Convergence of Cloud Infrastructure to a commodity? Competitors will copy good products until they all look similar? In that case, could you abstract the cloud provider service away from the service (similaer to virtualisation and containers?)
